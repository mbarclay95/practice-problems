# Install our tools for running code
To start, we will install brew, nvm, and node. Brew is a software for mac which is used to manage lots of different packages and libraries. We will use it to install nvm (Node Version Manager), which will be used to install and maintain different versions of node. Node is what we use to run the code that we will be writing. Instructions to install all three of these can be found [here](https://tecadmin.net/install-nvm-macos-with-homebrew/).

Once these have been installed we can make sure node is working by running `node -v` in the terminal. 

We can then run our first program by running `npm run hello-world` in the terminal.

Once everything is working lets go work on some practice problems [here](https://github.com/py-study-group/beginner-friendly-programming-exercises/blob/master/exercises.md).
